# KizmasanaAvatar

Welcome to **KizmasanaAvatar**!  
This project is a digital **LUDO-based board game** inspired by the elemental world of **Avatar: The Last Airbender** and the stylized, social-game atmosphere of **Club Penguin**.

## 🎮 About the Game

**KizmasanaAvatar** is a turn-based board game built on classic **LUDO** mechanics. The game heavily draws inspiration from **Avatar: The Last Airbender**, especially in its elemental themes (fire, water, earth, air), visual language, and overall atmosphere.

At the same time, the art style and character presentation are influenced by **Club Penguin**, aiming for a simple, colorful, and accessible look rather than realism.

Players take turns moving their pawns across the board while interacting with a visually themed environment designed around these inspirations.

## ⚠️ Note About Assets and Development Process

As part of the course scope, all 3D models and some 2D visual assets used in this project were created with the help of AI-based tools. During development, we primarily used **Meshy.ai** for 3D model generation and **Gemini** to assist with certain visual and content-related tasks.

While these tools were useful during early prototyping, we encountered limitations related to free/trial account usage. In particular, some generated 3D models could not be downloaded or exported when preparing the final repository. We explored alternative approaches and worked with the available resources, but as a result, some assets could not be included in their original or intended form.

Additionally, since several models were generated quickly for prototyping purposes, some of the included assets may exceed the intended optimization target (approximately 10,000 polygons).

To keep the project reviewable and understandable, screenshots from both the Unity editor and in-game scenes are provided to demonstrate the intended visual style, asset usage, and overall design. The project is still under active development, and further improvements and optimizations are planned.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap: AR Implementation

* **Augmented Reality (AR):** We are currently working on implementing AR features. The goal is to project the game board onto a real-world surface and allow players to see Avatar-themed pawns and elements within a physical environment.

## 📸 Screenshots
