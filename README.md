# KizmasanaAvatar

Welcome to **KizmasanaAvatar**! This project is a unique blend of classic board game mechanics and social MMO elements.

## 🎮 About the Game

**KizmasanaAvatar** is a turn-based board game that combines the strategic gameplay of **Ludo** with the social, interactive atmosphere of **Club Penguin**.

Players navigate a digital board, competing against others in a turn-based format while enjoying a stylized, avatar-based environment reminiscent of classic web-based social games.

## ⚠️ Important Note Regarding Assets

Please be aware of the following limitations regarding the 3D assets in this repository:

*   **AI Model Availability:** We utilized various AI generation tools (such as Meshy.ai) during the development of this project. Due to the limitations of free trial accounts used during creation, we were unable to download or export some of the generated models for the final build.
*   **Poly Count:** As a result of the generation process, some of the models that are present exceed the optimized 10,000 polygon range.

While the source files for some models may be missing or unoptimized, we have included screenshots from both the in-game view and the editor to demonstrate the project's visual style and intended design.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap: AR Implementation

*   **Augmented Reality (AR):** Without further ado, we are currently working on implementing AR features. Soon, you will be able to project the game board onto your table and watch your avatars move around in your actual physical space.
