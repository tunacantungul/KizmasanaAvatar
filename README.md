# KizmasanaAvatar

Welcome to **KizmasanaAvatar**! This project is a unique blend of classic board game mechanics and social MMO elements.

## 🎮 About the Game

**KizmasanaAvatar** is a turn-based board game that combines the strategic gameplay of **Ludo** with the social, interactive atmosphere of **Club Penguin**.

Players navigate a digital board, competing against others in a turn-based format while enjoying a stylized, avatar-based environment reminiscent of classic web-based social games.

## ⚠️ Note About Assets and Development Process

As part of the course scope, all 3D models and some 2D visual assets used in this project were created with the help of AI-based tools. During development, we primarily used **Meshy.ai** for 3D model generation and **Gemini** for supporting certain visual and content-related tasks.

While these tools were helpful during early prototyping, we encountered limitations related to free/trial account usage. In particular, some generated 3D models could not be downloaded or exported when preparing the final repository. We explored alternative approaches and worked with the available resources, but as a result, some assets could not be included in their original or intended form.

Additionally, since several models were generated quickly for prototyping purposes, some of the included assets may exceed the intended optimization target (approximately 10,000 polygons).

To ensure the project remains reviewable and understandable, screenshots from both the Unity editor and in-game scenes are provided to demonstrate the intended visual style, asset usage, and overall design. The project is still under active development, and further improvements and optimizations are planned.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap: AR Implementation

* **Augmented Reality (AR):** We are currently working on implementing AR features. The goal is to project the game board onto a real-world surface and allow players to see avatars and pawns move within a physical environment.

## 📸 Screenshots
